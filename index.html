							<h2>Transport Options</h2>
							<section id="from-ist">
								
								<p><strong>If possible, we highly recommend choosing a flight with SAW as the destination airport, as it would be much easier for local transportation.</strong></p>

								<h3>From IST Airport to Campus</h3>
								<p>There are 2 choices.</p>
								<p>1. Taxi: The easiest way to get to the campus is to take a taxi from the airport. The cost is around 50 euros, and it takes around ~60 minutes to get to the campus.</p>
								<p>2. Another option is to use HAVAIST shuttle from IST to Sabiha Gökçen Airport (SAW) and then take a taxi to the campus from there. However, the HAVAIST schedules are limited, so you might need to wait at the airport, but it will be much cheaper.</p>
								<small><p>Please check <a href="https://www.hava.ist/sefer-saatleri.php?lang=en" target="_blank"> <b style="color: lightcoral;">HERE</b> </a> for more information on HAVAIST schedule and the shuttle line, and choose "ISTANBUL HAVALIMANI" to "SABIHA GOKCEN AIRPORT", and hit "List Trips".</p></small>
